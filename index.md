### CPSC 120

* Lab 12, Part 1
I think this was the most fun I had for a lab. It was definitely challenging for sure, but once you figured everything out it gets pretty easy. It was interesting to learn to draw different colors and lines with the C++. Just being able to do that with some simple lines of code is really cool, and you could probably do a lot with it if you experiment a little with it. Easily one of my favorite labs.

* Lab 4 Part 1
This was another one that was really fun. Doing functions to calculate teaspoons was really interesting to learn how to use the functions to find different sizes of ingredients. Just knowing the math is nice to know and figuring it all out. 

* Lab 11 Part 1
This one was just interesting to me just because I found it really challenging. For the lab we had listed out a capital and its population. It was pretty hard to do as we had to make the code get specific columns to form a text document. It was fun to try and figure it out. When I finally finished it, it felt good to finish the code that hard, felt like I really did learn stuff.
